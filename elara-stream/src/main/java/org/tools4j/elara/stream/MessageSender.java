/**
 * Facilitates sending of messages on arbitrary transport media.
 * <p>
 * Message sending can be done in two ways: messages already stored in a buffer can be sent via one of the
 * {@link #sendMessage(DirectBuffer, int, int) sendMessage(..)} methods.  Alternatively the message can be encoded into
 * the sending transport buffer directly as follows:
 * <pre>
 *     try (SendingContext context = sendingMessage()) {
 *         int length = context.buffer().putStringAscii(0, "Hello world");
 *         context.send(length);
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * Note that {@code SendingContext} implements {@link AutoCloseable} and if message sending is performed inside a
 * try-resource block as in the example above then sending will be {@link SendingContext#abort() aborted} automatically
 * if {@link SendingContext#send(int) send(..)} is not called for instance due to an exception.
