 * Agent to poll and publish events.

 * The agent invokes the output handler with committed events and replay flag during replay.  A tracking poller is used
 * to store the index of the last event passed to the handler.  A second poller is used to also pass replayed events to
 * the output handler.  Using a {@link CommittedEventPoller} as tracking poller guarantees that only committed events
 * are passed to the handler.
