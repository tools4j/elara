 * Facilitates sending of commands when

 * events.
 * <p>
 * Command sending can be done in two ways: already coded commands can be sent via one of the
 * {@link #sendCommand(DirectBuffer, int, int) sendCommand(..)} methods.  Alternatively the command can be encoded into
 * the sending transport buffer directly as follows:
 * <pre>
 *     try (SendingContext context = sendingEvent()) {
 *         int length = context.buffer().putStringAscii(0, "Hello world");
 *         context.send(length);
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * Note that {@code SendingContext} implements {@link AutoCloseable} and if command sending is performed inside a
 * try-resource block as in the example above then sending will be {@link SendingContext#abort() aborted} automatically
 * if {@link SendingContext#send(int) send(..)} is not called for instance due to an exception.
