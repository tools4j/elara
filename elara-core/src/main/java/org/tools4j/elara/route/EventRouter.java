/**
 * Facilitates routing of events when
 * {@link CommandProcessor#onCommand(Command, EventRouter) processing} commands.
 * <p>
 * Event routing can be done in two ways: already coded events can be routed via one of the
 * {@link #routeEvent(DirectBuffer, int, int) routeEvent(..)} methods.  Alternatively the event can be encoded into the
 * event store buffer directly as follows:
 * <pre>
 *     try (RoutingContext context = routingEvent()) {
 *         int length = context.buffer().putStringAscii(0, "Hello world");
 *         context.route(length);
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * Note that {@code RoutingContext} implements {@link AutoCloseable} and if event routing is performed inside a
 * try-resource block as in the example above then routing will be {@link RoutingContext#abort() aborted} automatically
 * if {@link RoutingContext#route(int) route(..)} is not called for instance due to an exception.
